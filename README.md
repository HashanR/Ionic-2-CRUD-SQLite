Simple Ionic 2 CRUD app for Add, Update, Delete and Search records from SQLITE Database
=====================

Ionic CLI and Cordova
To create Ionic projects, you’ll need to install the latest version of the CLI and Cordova. Before you do that, you’ll need a recent version of Node.js. Download the installer for Node.js 6 or greater and then proceed to install the Ionic CLI and Cordova for native app development:

$ npm install -g ionic cordova

You may need to add “sudo” in front of these commands to install the utilities globally
